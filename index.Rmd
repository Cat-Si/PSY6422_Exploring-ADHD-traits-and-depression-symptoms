## Introduction

### Research Question 

The visualisation with explore the following question: 

_**Does the relationship between ADHD traits and depression symptoms exist through difficulties in emotion regulation?**_

### Data Origin

The data used in this project was collected as part of a BSc (hons) Forensic Psychology level 6 project at Staffordshire University titled *"Is there a relationship between emotion regulation, empathy and depression in healthy individuals reporting ADHD traits?"* by Catherine Sheen*. It builds on the previous findings that statistically emotion regulation mediated the relationship between depression symptoms and ADHD traits and endevours to visually represent these findings. The analysis includes results from the [Adult ADHD self-report Scale (ASRS)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10401230600801077), the [Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)](https://doi.org/10.1023/B:JOBA.0000007455.08539.94), and the [Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F014662167700100306).

## Data wrangling   
  *** 

Before any visualisations could be conducted on the data, a large amount of data wangling was required to get it to a usable form. 

```{r results = 'hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#open library packages 

library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
library(fBasics)
library(reshape2)

data <- read.csv(here("raw", "Raw.csv"))

#show current column names 
colnames(data)

#remove the consent form columns Q2_1:Q2_8, quit question and empathy quotient
df = select(data, 
            -c(Q2_1:Q2_8, Q6, Q8, Q10, Q12, Q14, Q16, Q18, Q11_1:Q11_60)

#checking df is as it should be

Checking the final cleaned data set prior to visualisation 


```{r}

```



## Visualisation  
***

 

#### *Pre-defining appearance* 
```{r}
themeadj = theme_light(base_size = 15) + #plot theme appearance
            theme(legend.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour =)) + #adj legend appearance
              theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust = )) + #plot title size/typeface
                theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 8)) #plot caption location/size

```

#### *Plotting the Graph* 
```{r}
  
p <- ggplot(df, aes(asrs, cesd,)) 
  p <- p +  geom_point(mapping = aes(size = ders, color = ders)) +
       geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, colour = "black") +
        scale_x_continuous(name="ADHD trait score") + 
          scale_y_continuous(name="Depression symptom score") + 
            scale_color_gradient(low = "black", high = "magenta") +
              guides(size = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) + 
                themeadj
 p + ggtitle("Depression Symptoms in Relation to ADHD Traits and Emotion Regulation", ) +
      labs(color = "DERS Score*",
            size = "DERS Score*",
              caption = expression(italic("*DERS = Difficulties in Emotion Regulation"))) 
               
ggsave("figs/hi_res.png", height=8, width = 10, units = "in")

```
A decision was made to keep the graph simple and clear to not detract from the importance of the findings. 

## Shiny  
***
Further graphs where plotted to determine whether ADHD trait type (Innatentive/Hyperactive), or individual construct of emotion regulation explained the relationship. These graphs where plotted and combined into a shiny widget which has been included below. If issues occur rendering then the shiny can be viewed [here](https://catsheen.shinyapps.io/PSY6422/?_ga=2.120579596.580671623.1621871213-742831662.1621871213)

```{r error=FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://catsheen.shinyapps.io/PSY6422/?_ga=2.123750926.580671623.1621871213-742831662.1621871213")
```
